# LMTID
This official repository contains the source code and scripts for the paper "Leveraging Multiple Metrics to Improve Difficulty Calibration in Membership Inference Attacks " authored by Ning Zhou, Zetao Wang, Xiaoyan Liang, and Ruizhong Du.<br/><br/>
In this paper,We propose  LMTID(**L**everages **M**ultiple met-rics obtained during the model **T**raining to **I**mprove **D**ifficulty calibration), a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). By incorporating knowledge distillation and constructing multi-metric sequences from different training stages, LMTID addresses the limitations of existing difficulty calibration approaches and significantly enhances the attackâ€™s discriminative power.

# Supported Dataset and Model
_CIFAR10 CIFAR100 CINIC10 SVHN Location<br/>VGG16 MobileNetV2 ResNet50 DenseNet121_
# Usage instructions
We use VGG16 and CIFAR10 as examples to illustrate how to run_LMTID_<br/>
1. First, please download the CIFAR10 and put into `cifar-10-batches-py-official`.
2. Second, run He et al.'s method and get the calibrate membership score(save in `target_data.pt`and `shadow_data.pt`) .He et al .'s code can download on [Is Difficulty Calibration All We Need? Towards More Practical Membership Inference Attacks](https://github.com/T0hsakar1n/RAPID)
3. when you get the `target_data.pt`and `shadow_data.pt`,please put its in data/cal_data.
4. Once the above steps are completed,you can set the setting in `attackMethodsFramework.py` and run it to start the entire LMTID.
5. The ruselt while save in /result
6. After you get the ruselt you can use it to generate the ROC curve.part of LMTID result are put in /image,such as ![vgg16_cifar10](./image/vgg16_cifar10.png)![DenseNet121_cifar10](./image/DenseNet121_cifar10.png)
